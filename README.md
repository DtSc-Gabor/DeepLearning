For a thorough inspection of the work, please consider downloading the raw file and checking it in Jupyter Notebook, because:

    - the table of conetents with its prepared anchors failed to work on GitHub, 
        as well as the 'back to contents' buttons at the end of sections.
    - the prepared HTML content seems to render differently than in Jupyter Notebook
   

On the other hand, for a quick check of my work, please proceed with checking it <a href="https://github.com/DtSc-Gabor/DeepLearning/blob/main/Project_MNIST.ipynb">here</a>
